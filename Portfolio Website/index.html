        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Full Stack Developer based out of California</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I am a up and coming Full Stack Developer, based out Southern California with large interest in game development. I finished at the top of 
                my class with a 4.0 at Bethel School of Technology and am currently taking a course in Unity3D. I co-developed a social networking 
                application for Teen Challenge Alumni to help students stay in contact after graduating. I am currently investing time into creating my first mini game 
                through Unity3D. Before I decided to change gears and aspire to being a computer programer, I use to own and operate my own business "Independent Mobility Inc." 
                for about 9 years. I did everything from managing employees' workloads and projects, website design, dealt with all customer relations, managed employees'
                schedule, did all hiring, trained all employees on Quickbooks and shop projects, and managed all advertisement. Running a business was one of the most amazing 
                experiences of my life. This company was a full service retail mobility scooter store, were we
                sold and serviced our own design of high-end wheel chairs. Our scooters were the fastest and would go the furthest on the market reaching up to 20mph and and getting
                up to 60 mile on one charge. Our modo was "Get your Freedom back!" and thats what we did. 90% of our customers were disabled or elderly and were completely dependent on
                others, and our scooter gave them a chance to be independent and giving them the freedom to whatever whenever. It was so great to see how many people we help in that
                community before having to shut the door due to COVID. It was very sad having to close the doors but the experience of running my own business I feel has prepared me 
                for my next venture in life.          
            </p>
            <p>A little on my personal life, I have been married to my amazing wife Courtney for 9 years and have 3 beautiful girls, Eisley, Elfine, and Esther. 
                My Faith plays a huge role in my life. Some of my hobbies besides programming, would be gaming, politics, reading, and working out. I also Stream 
                on twitch when I do game my and my name is <a href= "https://www.twitch.tv/code_lettuce">code_lettuce</a> so if you want to check me out hit the link.
